# Welcome to the Wild Adventures Buddy Initiative!

The Wild Adventures Buddy Initiative (WABI) is a website created to incentivize people to touch grass (go outdoors). An issue that we noticed as a team was that people often choose to stay indoors or avoid physical exercise due to one sole reason: they don't have anyone to go with. As part of LA Hacks 2024, our team decided to create WABI as a solution to this issue. With this application, users can post their planned adventures (hiking, cycling, going to the beach, etc.). After postings have been created, other users, who want to participate in this activity can indicate their interest, after which they are automatically added to an in-app group chat. Additionally, the app incentivizes users to get more physical exercise through the built-in points, challenges, and leaderboard system.

# Future Plans

Although the hackathon has been completed, we want to continue to refine this application.

Some features we have in mind:
- Workout Logging
- Calorie Intake Tracking
- Calorie Calculator which can retrieve calorie counts of common food items
- AI Integration for fitness analysis
- Progress Graphs
